\title{funestim: A package for the mean estimation of a set of curves.}
\description{
The package provides functions in order to estimate the mean of a set of
curves. The idea is to perform non-parametric kernel regression of each of
curves using the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. In order to use this estimator,
we need to select a bandwidth. A common way to select this bandwidth is to
used cross-validation. However, we are going to use the large number of
curves to estimate it more efficiently. The idea is to estimate the
underlying regularity of the curves (assuming they have the same). Then, the
estimation of the bandwidth follows.

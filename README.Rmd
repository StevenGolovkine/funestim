`funestim` is an `R`-package that allows users to estimate the mean and the
covariance of a functional dataset using an estimation of the regularity of the curves. The curves can be irregularly sampled.


## Installation

To install the latest version directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/), 
please use 
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("StevenGolovkine/funestim")
```

## Dependencies

The `funestim` package depends on the `R`-packages [`fdapace`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fdapace),
[`funData`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=funData),
[`KernSmooth`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KernSmooth), [`magrittr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magrittr),
[`purrr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=purrr),
[`Rcpp`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Rcpp) and
[`RcppArmadillo`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RcppArmadillo),

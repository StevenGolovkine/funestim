#' funestim: A package for the mean estimation of a set of curves.
#' 
#' The package provides functions in order to estimate the mean of a set of 
#' curves. The idea is to perform non-parametric kernel regression of each of 
#' curves using the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. In order to use this estimator, 
#' we need to select a bandwidth. A common way to select this bandwidth is to 
#' used cross-validation. However, we are going to use the large number of 
#' curves to estimate it more efficiently. The idea is to estimate the 
#' underlying regularity of the curves (assuming they have the same). Then, the 
#' estimation of the bandwidth follows.
